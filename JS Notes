JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2020 Beginner

What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled at runtime. It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any machine ("host environment"). [Hosted Language]
JavaScript was created to make webpages more dynamic (e.g. change content on a page directly from inside the browser). Originally, it was called LiveScript but due to the popularity of Java, it was renamed to JavaScript.

JavaScript Engine (in browsers)
- Parse Code
- Compile to Machine Code
- Execute Machine Code [On a single Thread]
Chrome - V8
Firefox  SpiderMonkey

Dynamic, interpreted Programming Language
- Not pre-compiled, instead parsed and compiled “on the fly” (e.g. in the browser)
- Code evaluated and executed at runtime
- Code can change at runtime (e.g. type of a variable)
Weakly Typed Programming Language
- Data types are assumed (e.g. assigned to variables) automatically
- You don’t define that some variable has to hold a certain value (e.g. a number)
- Data types are not set in stone but can change

JavaScript Runs On A Host Environment
Browser-side 
= JavaScript was invented to create more dynamic websites by executing in the browser!
= JavaScript can manipulate the HTML code, CSS, send background Http requests & much more
= JavaScript CAN’T access the local filesystem, interact with the operating system etc
“Other” (e.g. Server-side)
= Google’s JavaScript Engine (V8) was extracted to run JavaScript anywhere (called “Node.js”)
= Node.js can be executed on any machine and is therefore often used to build web backends (server-side JavaScript)
= Node.js CAN access the local filesystem, interact with the operating system etc. It CAN’T manipulate HTML or CSS

A Brief Overview Of The JavaScript History
 1995 			Netscape introduces “LiveScript” / “JavaScript”
 1996 			Microsoft releases its own version for IE 
 Late 1996 		JavaScript submitted to ECMA International to start standardization
 1997 - 2005 	Standardization efforts, Microsoft didn’t really join and support the standardized JS version though
 2006 - 2011 	Huge progress in JavaScript ecosystem, Microsoft eventually joined forces
 
ECMAScript
= A standards organization that evoloves the ECMAScript language
= JavaScript is the most famouns ECMAScript implementation (others - ActionScript and Jscript)
= ECMAScript isn't directly used by browser vendors
= Each browser comes wtih its won JavaScript Engine, which defines which features will be supported
= ECMAScript and JavaScript both are actively developed.
